# Microbiome Data Analyses Workshop - Online (MDAWO)

## A PEMA Hands-on for 16S rRNA data

Here you can find all the relative material from the [MDAWO](https://mdawo.meetinghand.com/) - April 20 - 23, 2021. 

If it was not for the Covid-19 we would have all met in Belgium at the University of Hasselt. 
In any case, great talks, great software, great people!  

Many thanks to [Dr. Sofie Thijs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiethijs/?originalSubdomain=be) for the chance of presenting 
[PEMA](http://pema.hcmr.gr/) to such an event! 

The Pipeline for Environmental DNA Metabarcoding Analysis (PEMA)
 supports the complete analysis of 4 marker genes: 16S/18S rRNA, ITS and COI.
In its latest version a new module was added to enable the use of custom reference databases.
