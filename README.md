<br/><br/>
PEMA ([*Zafeiropoulos et al.* 2020](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/3/giaa022/5803335))
supports the complete analysis of 4 marker genes: 16S/18S rRNA, ITS and COI.
In its latest version a new module was added to enable the use of custom reference databases. 

You may find more about PEMA on its [documentation site](http://pema.hcmr.gr/)
but also on its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema).

* You may clone the repo by copying the `url` you see and run in a termial the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hariszaf/pema-mdawo.git
   ```

If it was not for the Covid-19 situation, MDAWO would take place in Belgium at the University of Hasselt
and we would be able to find out what else is great there besides the pralines. 


The sure thing though: great talks, great software, great people!  

Many thanks to [Dr. Sofie Thijs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiethijs/?originalSubdomain=be) for the chance of presenting 
[PEMA](http://pema.hcmr.gr/) to such an event!
