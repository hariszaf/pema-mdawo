## PEMA: A Pipeline for Environnmental DNA Metabarcoding Analysis 

<br/>

PEMA ([*Zafeiropoulos et al.* 2020](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/3/giaa022/5803335))
supports the complete analysis of 4 marker genes: 16S/18S rRNA, ITS and COI.
In its latest version a new module was added to enable the use of custom reference databases. 

You may find more about PEMA on its [documentation site](http://pema.hcmr.gr/)
but also on its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema). 


You may have a look on PEMAv2 on its recent presentation at [DNAQUAnet2021](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3EtwRbadjz-dBH4c30xEow).
