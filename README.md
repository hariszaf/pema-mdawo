# Microbiome Data Analyses Workshop - Online (MDAWO)

## A PEMA Hands-on for 16S rRNA data

Here you can find all the relative material from the [MDAWO](https://mdawo.meetinghand.com/) - April 20 - 23, 2021. 

The Pipeline for Environmental DNA Metabarcoding Analysis (PEMA) ([*Zafeiropoulos et al.* 2020](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/9/3/giaa022/5803335))
supports the complete analysis of 4 marker genes: 16S/18S rRNA, ITS and COI.
In its latest version a new module was added to enable the use of custom reference databases. 

You may find more about PEMA on its [documentation site](http://pema.hcmr.gr/)
but also on its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema).

If it was not for the Covid-19 situation, MDAWO would take place in Belgium at the University of Hasselt
and we would be able to find out what else is great there besides the pralines. 


The sure thing though: great talks, great software, great people!  

Many thanks to [Dr. Sofie Thijs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiethijs/?originalSubdomain=be) for the chance of presenting 
[PEMA]() to such an event!
