# PEMA hands-on @ MDAWO

In this folder, you will find some extra `.fastq.gz` files coming from samples from the same study with those 
we have already run in the first part of the hands-on. 

You will also find a `.csv` file called `extra_metadata.csv`. 


The aim is to follow the instructions on the presentation (or you may see below) and run 
a new PEMA analysis including both the initial and the samples stored here, their metadata as well.  


1. Download the `pema-mdawo` repository. 
You can either `git pull https://github.com/hariszaf/pema-mdawo.git` or download it as a `.zip` file.



2. Add the extra samples located at the `extra_material` directory. 




3. Edit the `parameters.tsv` file 



4. Change the name of the plots in the `phyloseq_in_PEMA.R` script



5. Edit the `phyloseq_in_PEMA.R` script


6. Upload again 


7. Edit the `.pbs` script. 



Many thanks to Dr. Christina Pavloudi for providing us with both data and their corresponding metadata.
